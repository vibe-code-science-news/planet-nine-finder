# Wavelength ranges of interest (microns)
wavelength_ranges:
  ideal: [70, 100] # Ideal range for Planet Nine detection (far-IR peak)
  good: [50, 200] # Good range for detection (broader far-IR)
  acceptable: [20, 500] # Acceptable range that might show something

# Search radii in degrees
search_radii:
  tight: 0.2 # Based on positional uncertainty calculation
  loose: 0.5 # Expanded search for potential wider coverage

# Quality criteria for classifying matches
quality_criteria:
  perfect_match:
    wavelength: 'ideal' # Must be in ideal wavelength range
    year_min: 2010 # Must be relatively recent data
    position_match: 'exact' # Must be very close to predicted position
  good_match:
    wavelength: 'good' # Must be in good wavelength range
    year_min: 2000 # Can be older data
    position_match: 'within_tight' # Must be within tight search radius

# Repository-specific settings
repositories:
